---------------------------------ABOUT AEREM-----------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


AEREM is a console application which will take painting to next level.
It will allow us to draw from air i.e. the picture or letter that we 
will be drawing in air will detected by the laptop-cam and thus will give
us the image of our drawing directly in the laptop.


For this purpose the object selected should be of yellow color( by default, otherwise use trackbar to select object color based on hsv value). 










--------------------------------TO RUN-----------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------




1. To run the Console Application you must have opencv installed
   on your system and included in the environment variables.For a tutorial follow this link http://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-windows/.
2. To detect the object by default it should be of YELLOW COLOR and avoid any
   other SAME COLOURED OBJECT in front of your webcam. You can change the color from 
   the trackbar provided, as per your convenience. You can use the threshold window to check whether your colour is being detected or not as well as to check the presence any spare same coloured object as the one being detected. 
3. To change the color of the pen you can choose it from the trackbar provided 
   for the purpose.
4. Similarly you can use the other trackbar to adjust the colour of drawing shown on the screen. 
5. You can also provide the image name and path where you want to save it, once you are done with your air drawing
